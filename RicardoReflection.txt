What's the most important thing you learned from this project?
		The most important thing I learned from this project is how seperate classes and files work together in Java. Calling functions from other files was one of the things that I struggled the most with at first but once I figured out how to call them it was easy and extremely valuable.
What's the most significant way your solution diverges from the sample solution in Python? (Explain in English; don't include more than very short snippets of code.)
		I would say that the most significant way that our program diverges from the Python sample solution is the way the game gets called and played. When I wrote this program in Python a few semesters ago, I wrote the playGame() function very poorly and it contained nearly a third of my code (which isn't beautilful code) and the way that we wrote it, the playGame() function is concise and the details get handled elsewhere.
How did you and your partner share the work? What did each team member contribute?
		Cooper and I both did some work individually, mainly the most basic components of the game, and then came together to plan how the game flow would work and how/where to call certain funcitons and then worked on those and put the game together. I got a lot of help from Cooper with the GitHub stuff and it also helped to have him bounce back ideas and check for bug fixes when I couldn't find them.
